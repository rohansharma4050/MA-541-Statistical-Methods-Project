### Key Takeaways
• Conducted comprehensive EDA and applied various statistical tests (Mann-Whitney, Fisher Exact, Chi-square, ANOVA) to uncover significant data relationships and derive actionable insights.

• Designed and evaluated multiple machine learning models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, kNN, XGBoost, and CatBoost, achieving top performance with CatBoost (MSE: 72.86, R²: 0.9955).

• Validated normal distribution adherence using QQ plots and ECDF plots, ensuring reliable application of parametric statistical analyses and boosting model accuracy.

• Utilized Z-tests to uncover significant differences in fuel efficiency between city and highway driving conditions, providing crucial insights for optimizing fuel consumption strategies (p-value: 3.87e-20).

• Applied Chi-square tests to identify significant associations between categorical variables, such as Fuel and Vehicle Class (chi-square statistic: 155.26, p-value: 3.47e-21), guiding data-driven decision-making.

The 2024 EPA Vehicle Fuel Economy dataset offers comprehensive records related to vehicle fuel efficiency, and Carbon emissions, along with vehicle related attributes. This study analyzes the dataset to employing rigorous statistical methods, and uncover and identify underlying patterns from vehicle performance to the environmental impact caused by it. Objectives include identifying factors influencing fuel economy and emissions, characterizing distributions across vehicle categories, assessing based on manufacturing vehicle component, and proposing strategies for improved efficiency. The report details data description, pre-processing, descriptive statistics, and inferential analysis, culminating in findings, implications, and future research directions. This analysis contributes to the discourse on vehicular impact on the environment, providing stakeholders with empirical insights for informed decision-making and sustainable practices.
